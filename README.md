# Building a Neural Network from scratch

An implementation of a basic neural network built solely using NumPy library. This was a small project I did while I first started doing research about neural networks and found the absolutly incredible book, ["Neural Networks and Deep Learning"](neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com) by Michael Nielsen. They did such an amazing job of explaining the magic behind these nerworks with code examples, I used it as a refrence to do my own implementation. 

This project turned out to be a great exercise to learn the fundamental concepts and principles of neural networks and deep learning. I was able to gain hands-on experience in building and training a neural network without the bells and whistles of state of the art frameworks like Tensorflow and Pytorch.  

This Multi-Layer Perceptron is capable of performing basic tasks such as image classification — as shown below, I used the popular MNIST Handwritten dataset to train the network — and can serve as a good starting point for more advanced deep learning projects.
