# Building a Neural Network from scratch

This is an implementation of a basic neural network built solely using NumPy. This was a small project I did while I first started doing research about neural networks and found the absolutly incredible book, ["Neural Networks and Deep Learning"](neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com) by Michael Nielsen. They did such an amazing job of explaining the magic behind these nerworks with code examples, I used it as a refrence to do my own implementation.
This neural network is capable of performing basic tasks such as image classification and can serve as a good starting point for more advanced deep learning projects.
